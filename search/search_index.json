There is not a correct or a wrong solution Feel free to ask me if you have any question: abbes.yassine@outlook.fr Arrays And Strings Question Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i.e., \u201cwaterbottle\u201d is a rotation of \u201cerbottlewat\u201d). Objected Oriented Design Question 1 Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: fresher, technical lead (TL), product manager (PM). There can be multiple employees, but only one TL or PM. An incoming telephone call must be allocated to a fresher who is free. If a fresher can\u2019t handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to technical lead. If the TL is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to PM. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method getCallHandler() to return the employee who get the call Question 2 Imagine you have an example of product: Design the classes and data structures to support this kind of product Implement a method getProduct() Sorting and Searching Question Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times, give an O(log n) algorithm that finds an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order. EXAMPLE: Input: find 5 in array (15 16 19 20 25 1 3 4 5 7 10 14) Output: 8 (the index of 5 in the array) Databases Question Imagine a simple database storing information for students\u2019 grades. Design what this database might look like, and provide a SQL query to return a list of the honor roll students (top 10%), sorted by their grade point average.
